# Flaky tests

A test that fails on one run and passes on the next is measured, not retried by hand.

## Finding them

```bash
swift build --build-tests
for i in $(seq 1 20); do
    swift test --skip-build --parallel --xunit-output "$TMPDIR/run$i.xml"
done
python3 Scripts/flake_report.py "$TMPDIR"/run*-swift-testing.xml
```

`Scripts/flake_report.py` reads two or more JUnit files and prints each test that passed in
one run and failed in another, with how many runs it failed. A test that fails in every run is
broken, not flaky, and is not listed.

## Quarantine

Each flaky test is either fixed at its cause (inject a clock; no real sleep, no real device)
or listed in `Scripts/flake_quarantine.json` as
`{"test": "<classname>/<name>", "owner_issue": "<number>", "expires": "YYYY-MM-DD"}`.

- A quarantined test still runs and its result is still reported; nothing is skipped.
- `make flake-audit`, part of `make verify`, fails when an entry is past its expiry or has
  no owner issue. The way past it is fixing the test or deleting it, not moving the date.

## Probe result

Not yet recorded. The test target does not compile on `origin/main` at the time this page was
written (`Tests/UttrflowAccountTests/LoopbackTests.swift`, a strict-concurrency
`SendingClosureRisksDataRace` error), so no run of the suite can be taken. Once it builds, run
the loop above twenty times on one Mac and record here: host, run count, tests run, and every
test `flake_report.py` lists.

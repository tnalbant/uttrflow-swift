# Word correction: the numbers and why they are what they are

`WordCorrectionEngine` replaces a word that does not belong in a sentence and otherwise
does nothing. The default is to do nothing; three conditions must all hold before one word
moves, and each number below is a hard stop rather than a tuning knob.

## The three conditions

1. **The recogniser was unsure**: every word in the run scored below `certaintyThreshold`.
2. **A candidate exists**: the phonetic index answers this in constant time.
3. **The sentence improves**: `CorrectionEvidence` scores both readings and the candidate
   must win by `improvementMargin`.

Each alone is a different failure. Condition one alone rewrites constantly, because
recognisers are unsure all the time. Condition two alone destroys correct-but-rare words:
"clawed" and "Claude" sound identical. Condition three alone is a model guessing at words it
has never seen.

## `certaintyThreshold = 0.5`

One number doing two jobs on purpose: the line under which a word may be replaced and the
line at or above which a word may corroborate a replacement. Because the two sets are exact
complements, a mis-heard word cannot vouch for itself. A half rather than a tuned value
because speech engines disagree about what their scores mean; a half is where any
recogniser claims to be more right than wrong.

## `improvementMargin = 2`

The single most important number in the engine. One signal is a coincidence: at a margin of
one, "the bear clawed the bark" becomes "the bear Claude the bark" for anyone with a file
called `Claude notes` open. At two it does not, because "clawed" and "Claude" have the same
shape and only one signal separates them. The changes that survive are the ones where the
recogniser visibly came apart (a word split, a word spelt out) and something in the
situation names the word it came apart into. Integers, because the signals are counts of
independent facts.

Recognition confidence does not scale this margin. `certaintyThreshold` already uses that
score to decide whether a word may be changed; once it is below the threshold, the score is
not calibrated across speech engines as a probability that the word is correct. The margin
therefore counts the same independent evidence for every eligible word. A word at 0.49 and
one at 0.05 need the same two-signal advantage to change, while a word at or above 0.5 is
never proposed and may corroborate another word. `CorrectionEvidenceTests` pins that boundary.

**The margin alone does not hold a run of several words**, which was measured rather than
argued. Every sentence in the restraint corpus used to be short enough that
`budget(for:)` was one, so a two-word proposal was discarded by the blast-radius cap and the
three restraint tests were measuring that cap rather than this margin. Padded to twelve
words, where the cap allows two changes, the same corpus produced "the salt **URL** enough
for the coast" and "read **Aditi** nobody": the entry is on screen and the run is several
words becoming one, which is two signals, which clears a margin of two.

So a run of several words has a condition of its own before the evidence is counted at all:
the entry must spell the run closed up, or open as it does — `ReadingRestraint`'s rule, which
the readings offered to the model have always been held to and the dictionary's own
corrections never were. "payment sheet" to `PaymentSheet` and "utter flow" to `Uttrflow` pass
it; "air well" to `URL` does not. An entry's pronunciation counts as well as its spelling, so
a user who writes "cube cuttle" against `Kubectl` gets that run back.

## `maximumChangedInEvery = 5`, with a floor of one

An engine that wants to change a third of an utterance has misread it, so the whole
utterance is left alone rather than the first few changes applied. The budget counts spoken
words, not proposals. Its floor of one is not a softening: without it every dictation under
five words would be exempt, and short dictations are most of them.

## `maximumWordsOnScreen = 512`

A selection can be a whole document and this runs inside a dictation. Five hundred words
covers a visible page, and the scan is not measurable at that size. Past the cap the screen
stops corroborating, which is the safe direction to fail in.

## Why condition three is not a language model

Every word the engine can propose is, by construction, one a general model has never seen;
that is why it is in a personal dictionary. Asking Apple's on-device model whether
"Uttrflow" belongs in a sentence buys an opinion formed from no evidence, at one model call
per uncertain word on a path that already spends two seconds. Word embeddings return nothing
for out-of-vocabulary words, which is every word here. So the question is answered from
evidence already in hand: four independent signals of equal weight, read from the utterance
and from what the frontmost app shows, scored for both readings so a rare word heard
correctly usually has the evidence on its side.

## Cost

Ten thousand entries, a forty-word utterance with half the words doubted and a screenful of
selected text: about half a millisecond per dictation on an M-series Mac. The test does not
time it, because a wall clock in a parallel suite on a loaded machine fails with nothing wrong.
It counts instead: the dictionary entries the lookups read are the same over ten thousand
entries as over fifty, and the screen is read once per utterance however many runs are
doubted. A lookup that scanned the dictionary, or evidence rebuilt per run, fails it.

## The restraint corpus

`CorrectionRestraintTests` runs 28 correct sentences with every word doubted, three ways:
with no screen, with the sentence itself on screen, and with the whole fixture dictionary on
screen. The passing score is zero changes. A guard test asserts that at least fifteen of the
sentences tempt the dictionary (sixteen do: "clawed" and "clod" find `Claude`, "sickle"
finds `SQL`, "nickel" finds `Nikhil`, "smell" finds `XML`, "readies" finds `Redis`, "griffin"
finds `Grafana`, "air well" finds `URL`), so silence is restraint rather than coincidence.
That exact count is pinned by `corpusIsTempting`, so it cannot drift from this page unnoticed.

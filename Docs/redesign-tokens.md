# Redesign tokens

The redesign's colours and typeface live beside the current ones so screens can move to them
one at a time. Nothing draws them until a screen is changed on purpose.

## Colours

`BrandPalette.Redesign` in `Sources/Uttrflow/Brand/BrandPalette.swift` holds them. A
`BrandTone` is a solid dark/light pair; a `BrandLayer` is a tone drawn at an opacity, for the
translucent card film, hairline, sidebar island and secondary text of the dark appearance.

Text tones clear 4.5:1 on the page and on a card; accents clear 3:1 there, the bar for marks.
The floating button's ink clears 4.5:1 on its glass and the meter 3:1, measured over the
same dark and light desktops `Docs/app-dock.md` uses.
`BrandPaletteTests` measures both.

### The Insights calendar's day numbers

Every tile is `#5FE0D3` at a shade, in both appearances, over the card's film. In dark the
number is white up to a shade of 0.5 and `calendarDeepInk` (`#04332F`) from 0.72, and no tile
is drawn between the two, because there neither ink reaches 4.5:1:

| Shade | White | `#04332F` |
|---|---|---|
| 0.50 | 4.84:1 | 2.86:1 |
| 0.61 | 3.67:1 | 3.77:1 |
| 0.72 | 2.83:1 | 4.87:1 |

A tile whose share of the busiest day lands in that band is drawn at the nearer edge. Light
clears 9:1 with either ink on every shade. `InsightsCalendarDay.shade` holds the rule.

## Typeface

Headings use Outfit, a variable font under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. The font file and its
licence ship together in `Sources/Uttrflow/Resources/Fonts/`, as the licence requires.
`BrandFont` registers it for the process at launch and falls back to the system font when the
file is missing or registration fails.

# Making speech accuracy measurable

**What is built:** the passages, the scorer, `uttrflow-eval record`, `uttrflow-eval transcribe`
and its regression gate all exist and work offline. **What is open:** nobody has recorded the
corpus yet, and whether a recording is ever committed is an owner decision (see
[committing the audio](#committing-the-audio-a-real-decision-not-a-detail)). To pick the
command a given change needs, start at [measure-a-change.md](measure-a-change.md). The
targets a measurement is held to are in [accuracy-targets.md](accuracy-targets.md).

This page was first written after WhisperKit 1.1.0 was declined because nobody could say whether
it was better or worse, and it keeps the reasoning for the smallest thing that answers that.

**The package depends on 1.1.0 anyway, and that is not a change of mind.** `Package.swift`
declared `from: "0.18.0"` when this repository was published on 29 August; dependabot raised
it to 1.1.0 the same day (`34b8440`, a `version-update:semver-major`), and this page was
written the next morning without noticing. So the version this document says was declined is
the version the recogniser has been running on since before the document existed — a
major-version change to the dictation path that arrived without the measurement argued for
below, because nothing gates it. The argument still stands; only its premise was stale.

**Nothing gates it, so the version no longer floats.** `Package.swift` now pins WhisperKit
exactly, for the reason Sparkle is pinned exactly and this one was not: a `from:` range lets
a dependabot bump change how every dictation is decoded, and until the baseline below exists
there is nothing that would notice. The pin is not a claim that 1.1.0 is the right version —
it is a claim that moving off it should be somebody's decision rather than a Tuesday. What
the repository does assert about the recogniser it links is in `WhisperKitContractTests`:
the context window, the prompt cap `VocabularyPrompt` sizes itself to, the prefill length
the timestamp rules count from, and every decoding option the product names. Those fail a
build when upstream moves them; the words coming out still need the corpus.

## The finding

**Almost all of it already exists.** The blocker is fifteen minutes of somebody reading
out loud, not the sixteen hours the operator runbook implies.

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| The passages to read | **Written.** 18 of them, in `TranscriptionCorpus.swift` |
| A scorer, with `mustKeep` enforcement | **Written.** `TranscriptionScorer` |
| Recording tool that works offline | **Written.** `uttrflow-eval record` |
| Scoring tool that works offline | **Written.** `uttrflow-eval transcribe` |
| A regression gate for CI | **Written.** `--fail-on-regression --tolerance` |
| **The audio** | **Missing. This is the whole gap.** |

## Why the sixteen hours is the wrong number

The runbook says *"about a thousand samples, roughly sixteen hours"*, and that is why this
has never been started. But a thousand samples is **many speakers in many settings** —
statistical power to say *"Uttrflow hears Indian-accented English this well"*, which is a
claim about the product.

Deciding whether a version bump made things worse needs something much weaker: **the same
voice, the same passages, the same room, before and after.** Every source of variance
except the engine is held constant, so a difference is attributable. One reader is not a
weakness there; it is the design.

The repository already computes what that costs. `TranscriptionCorpus.estimatedReadingTime`
uses 120 words a minute plus thirty seconds a passage for settling and retakes:

```
18 passages · 686 words  →  14.7 minutes
```

| Language | Passages | Words |
|---|---|---|
| English | 6 | 302 |
| Hindi | 6 | 201 |
| Hinglish | 6 | 183 |

Five stressors are covered: everyday speech, proper nouns, digits, technical terms, and
false starts. Those are exactly the axes on which recognisers differ — a model that
regresses usually regresses on names and numbers first, and both are already isolated.

**So the minimum viable corpus is the one already written. It needs reading once.**

## It already works without the backend

This was the other assumption worth checking, because it is what stops a contributor
running any of it. Both defaults are already the local ones:

- **`record` writes to disk first.** `--corpus-path` is where recordings go; `--upload` is
  an opt-in extra that offers each take to the corpus service as it is recorded. `--sync`
  is a separate, later step — it sends whatever `--upload` could not and does no
  recording of its own, so it is not something to add to a first recording run. The
  comment in `RecordCorpus.swift` is explicit that the local write is the commit and
  uploading is layered on top, so a dead connection costs an upload and never a take.
- **`transcribe` reads local recordings by default.** `--from-catalogue` is the flag that
  goes to the backend instead. Nobody needs `CORPUS_BUCKET` or an operator token to measure
  a change.

Nothing has to be built for the offline path. It is the path.

## What it would take

```bash
# once, ~15 minutes
uttrflow-eval record --corpus-path ./corpus --cohort <reader>-quiet \
                     --speaker <label> --setting "quiet room, built-in mic"

# per engine change, unattended
uttrflow-eval transcribe --corpus-path ./corpus --engine whisperKit \
                         --baseline ./baseline.json --save-baseline

# afterwards, to compare
uttrflow-eval transcribe --corpus-path ./corpus --engine whisperKit \
                         --baseline ./baseline.json --fail-on-regression
```

`--fail-on-regression` exits non-zero when any slice has got worse, with `--tolerance` in
percentage points. Results are reported **by language, by stressor and by cohort** and are
never pooled into one number — an engine that improves on English and regresses on Hinglish
has not improved, and `AccuracyBaseline` already refuses to average that away. A run the
gate cannot give a verdict on — different label, no shared samples, a changed recording,
or a baseline/run whose normalisation rules are not recorded — also exits non-zero, since
"no verdict" is not "no regression". The printed reason names which side needs re-measuring.

**The gate checks it is still the exact recording set, not just the same case IDs.** Every
score carries a `recordingIdentity` — a digest of the WAV bytes for a local take, the
catalogue's own key for a backend sample — and `--save-baseline` stores it per passage.
A later `--fail-on-regression` run refuses an ordinary verdict, rather than reporting a
regression or a pass, when a shared case ID's identity has changed: the passage was read
again since the baseline, and the movement is the new recording's, not the engine's. A
baseline captured before this existed is reported the same way against a freshly identified
run — unverifiable rather than silently treated as the same take.

## What this would have said about WhisperKit 1.1.0

The decision that could not be made, made:

```
uttrflow-eval transcribe --corpus-path ./corpus --engine whisperKit \
                         --baseline ./baseline-0.18.0.json --fail-on-regression
```

Three outcomes, each with an obvious next step:

- **No slice moves beyond tolerance.** The bump is neutral on accuracy, so it is judged on
  its costs alone — and 1.1.0 has one, a second copy of the Hugging Face download code
  linked into the app as `ArgmaxCore`. Neutral benefit against a real cost is a decline,
  but a decline for a stated reason.
- **Hinglish or proper nouns regress.** Decline, with a number, and a bug report upstream
  worth writing.
- **Something improves materially.** Now the `ArgmaxCore` duplication is a trade rather than
  a pure cost, and the conversation is about whether `Hub` can be dropped.

Today none of those can be reached, so the answer defaults to "no" for every speech-engine
change — which is a decision made by absence rather than on merit.

## Public datasets: later, and only for one axis

Common Voice (CC0) and LibriSpeech (CC BY 4.0) are both permissively licensed and could be
redistributed. They are **not** a shortcut here:

- Neither contains Hinglish, which is a third of this corpus and the part most likely to
  regress.
- Their audio comes with its own reference text, so the `mustKeep` requirements — the names,
  version numbers and technical terms these passages were written around — do not apply.
  A different thing would be measured.
- They answer *"how does this engine do on many voices?"*, not *"did this change break
  anything?"*

They earn their place later, for the accent axis, once there is a baseline to extend. Not
for the first fifteen minutes.

## Committing the audio: a real decision, not a detail

A corpus in the repository is what would let a contributor verify an engine change. Size is
not the obstacle — 686 words is about 5.7 minutes of speech:

| Format | Size |
|---|---|
| 16 kHz mono WAV (what the store writes) | ~11 MB |
| FLAC | ~5.5 MB |
| Opus, 24 kbps | ~1 MB |

**The obstacle is that a voice recording is personal data.** It is biometric, it is
identifiable, and publishing it is irreversible in exactly the way this repository has
already had cause to think carefully about. `Scripts/pii_audit.sh` would not catch it,
because it reads text.

Three options, and this is the operator's call:

1. **Do not commit it.** Contributors record their own fifteen minutes and get a baseline
   for their own voice — which is all a regression check needs, since the comparison is
   always before-and-after on one voice. Costs a contributor fifteen minutes; keeps nobody's
   voice in a public repository.
2. **Commit it, with the reader's informed consent**, understanding it cannot be withdrawn.
   Best reproducibility: everybody measures the same audio.
3. **Commit a public-dataset subset** for English only, and keep the Hindi and Hinglish
   recordings local. Reproducible for part of the corpus, silent on the part that matters
   most.

**Option 1 is the recommendation.** The corpus is fifteen minutes of reading; asking a
contributor who wants to change the speech engine to spend fifteen minutes is proportionate,
and it avoids publishing a voice for a benefit — shared audio — that a regression check does
not actually need.

## What is not built

No new tooling. Every command above exists. The gap is a recording session and a decision
about where the audio lives, and inventing a corpus format or a scoring harness to sit
beside the ones already written would be the opposite of the smallest thing that works.

The thousand-sample corpus in `Docs/operator-runbook.md` is still the right ambition for
claiming an accuracy *number*. It is simply not what is needed to catch a regression, and
conflating the two is what has kept both at zero.

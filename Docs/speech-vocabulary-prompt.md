# Conditioning Whisper on the user's own words

`VocabularyPrompt` in `Sources/UttrflowSpeech/VocabularyPrompt.swift` turns the personal
dictionary into the prompt Whisper is conditioned on *before* it decodes anything.

This is where a personal dictionary is worth the most. Rewriting "utter flow" to "Uttrflow"
afterwards is a repair, and one that only fires when the recogniser happened to produce
something close enough to match; putting the word in front of the decoder makes it hear the
word.

## The budget is 111 tokens, not 448 and not 224

Not the model's 448-token context, and not half of it either. WhisperKit trims the prompt to
`(Constants.maxTokenContext / 2) - 1`, and `maxTokenContext` is itself `Int(448 / 2)` — 224 —
so the real ceiling is 111.

> WhisperKit 1.1.0: `Core/TextDecoder.swift:199` for the expression, `Core/Models.swift:1340`
> for the constant. Both numbers are asserted against the linked package by
> `WhisperKitContractTests`, so a bump that moves them fails the build rather than this page.

Truncating here rather than leaving it to the decoder is the whole point. WhisperKit keeps
the *last* 111 tokens and drops the rest without a word, so a vocabulary ranked best-first
would lose precisely the words worth having. It is not a rare case either: `WorkingSet`
offers up to 28 words, matching the measured vocabulary that usually fits this budget.
Long technical words can still make the token budget bind before that word limit.

Words manually added during the last seven days rank ahead of older entries, newest first.
This keeps a just-corrected name in front of entries that have accumulated a few uses. The
Diagnostics page shows the exact dictionary words kept by the latest Whisper prompt; that
personal list stays on screen and is omitted from copied diagnostics.

Packing is word by word rather than a truncation mid-sequence: half of `PaymentSheet` in the
prompt biases the decoder towards something the user has never said. A word too long for what
is left is skipped rather than ending the packing, so one forty-token monster cannot cost the
fifty ordinary words ranked behind it. The separator belongs to the word rather than sitting
between words, because dropping a word that will not fit must not leave its separator behind.

Special tokens are filtered out of every piece. WhisperKit discards them itself, so filtering
here as well is what keeps the count being budgeted equal to the count that survives.

## The sentence around the words is the surprise

The words are offered inside `" The words used here are …"`, and that framing is not
decoration — it is the single most surprising thing measured here.

| Prompt                                 | What the decoder heard |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `Uttrflow Nikhil PaymentSheet`          | "KidPit"               |
| the same words inside the sentence      | "Uttrflow"             |

The sentence worked with three words in the list and again with fourteen. Whisper's prompt is
trained as the *transcript that came before*, so text shaped like a transcript is what it
knows how to condition on; a glossary is not. It is closed with a full stop for the same
reason it is opened like a sentence.

## The words are spaced, not punctuated

The words are separated by a space alone. A comma between them is copied into the transcript:
Whisper's prompt is read as the transcript that came before, so the mark between two listed
words is the style the decoder continues when the audio says those two words next to each
other — which a first and last name does.

Measured on the bench's `nouns-vocabulary` clips, `nouns0` and `nouns1` in all three English
voices, 21 September 2026 at `7deb139a`, against the shipping turbo model:

| Separator | Clips with an adjacent pair that gained a comma | `nouns-vocabulary` raw WER |
|---|---|---|
| `", "`    | 6 of 6 — "Zorvane, Kelthmar", "Ask Mirvella, Ostrander," | 0.0% |
| `" "`     | 0 of 6 | 0.0% |

Every dictionary word is still heard: the sentence around the words is what conditions the
decoder, not the punctuation inside it. The word error rate cannot show this either way, since
it drops punctuation — which is why the comma went unnoticed for so long.

The budget is unchanged at 111, and a space costs no more than the comma it replaces: no token
in the model's vocabulary begins with a comma followed by a space or a letter, so `", " + word`
encoded the comma on its own and every word past the first now costs one token less. More of
the dictionary fits, never less.

## The forced prefill, and why a prompt otherwise returns nothing

WhisperKit forces a fixed run of tokens through the decoder before the transcript begins:

```
[<|startofprev|>] + prompt + [<|startoftranscript|>, language, task, timestamps]
```

The language and task tokens are absent when the model only knows English.

> WhisperKit 1.1.0, `Core/TextDecoder.swift:163-223`.

WhisperKit 0.18 ended a window the moment the sampler predicted the end token — *including*
while it was still force-feeding the prompt, when whatever the sampler produced is thrown away
anyway. Every conditioning prompt tripped that and returned an empty transcript. 1.1.0 ignores
an end token sampled during its own prefill (`Core/TextDecoder.swift:679-686`) and honours one
sampled at the last prefill token, which is the first real prediction.

`DecoderPrefill` counts that run once, and it is the only place the count is written. A prompt
that survives trimming brings a `<|startofprev|>` token with it; a prompt that does not is
dropped whole and takes that token with it.

## The prompt shares the 223-position decode budget with the transcript

The prefill tokens occupy the left end of the decoder's context, and the transcript's words and
timestamps occupy the rest. WhisperKit sizes the context at `Constants.maxTokenContext = 224`
and lets the decode loop run up to `initialPromptIndex - 1 + sampleLength` steps, where the
`sampleLength` here is also `maxTokenContext`. That is **223 positions shared between the forced
prompt and the transcript** — not added on top of one another.

A full prompt leaves about 108 positions for the words, and Hindi writes roughly 4.7 tokens per
Devanagari word, so a Hindi piece over ~23 words on a full prompt, or ~44 words on the one-word
shipped prompt, runs out of room mid-word. Issue #961 is the user-visible form of this budget
collision. `CappedDecodeRetry` recovers the audio past the cap by re-decoding the tail; the
underlying budget is unchanged.

Each retry is a fresh decode with the same prompt, so it advances by the same ~23 or ~44 Hindi
words, and `CappedDecodeRetry.maxRetries` is 10: one dictation recovers at most roughly 230 to
440 Hindi words past the cap. A dictation that is still capped when the retries run out is
marked `DecodeEffort.capUnresolved` rather than returned as if it were complete (#1727).

## Two decoding options that cost something

**`wordTimestamps: true`** is the only way to get a per-word probability out of WhisperKit,
and correction's first condition is that the recogniser was unsure. Measured on the shipping
turbo model:

| Clip length | Added time | Share of the transcription |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| 3.3 s       | +4.1 ms   | 0.9%                        |
| 24.3 s      | +19.1 ms  | 1.4%                        |

Cheap enough that the alternative — a constant confidence, making the condition either
vacuous or unsatisfiable — was never worth considering.

**`promptTokens`** is applied once, ahead of the prefill, and re-forced for every 30-second
window: WhisperKit builds the decoder's initial prompt before its seek loop and never
overwrites it, so a two-minute dictation is biased just as strongly at the end as at the
start. It costs the prefill cache and part of each window's decode budget, which is why the
111 tokens are a ceiling rather than a target.

## Failing open

An empty vocabulary, an absent tokeniser, or one that nothing survives leaves the decoding
options exactly as they would be without any of this. That trade is deliberate: a word missing
from the prompt costs the user a correction, and a dictation refused because a word would not
encode costs them the dictation.

## The `PromptTokenizer` seam

The arithmetic above is checked against a tokeniser a test writes in three lines rather than
against a 646 MB download. Its only real implementation adapts WhisperKit's own and lives
beside the recogniser.

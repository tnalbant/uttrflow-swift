# Fetches the sign-in provider marks that this repository deliberately does not carry.
#
# Google's four-colour G is Google's trademark. Shipping it inside an app that implements
# Google Sign-In is what it is published for; redistributing it in a public source
# repository is a different act, and not one the asset terms clearly allow. So the mark is
# gitignored and fetched from the source Google publishes it at, by whoever is building.
#
# The same reasoning covers GitHub's Invertocat. Apple's mark needs nothing: it ships with
# the system as the `apple.logo` SF Symbol.
#
# Nothing here is required to build or run the app. `ProviderMark` in OnboardingView.swift
# renders nothing when the resource is absent, so a build without these marks gets sign-in
# buttons carrying their wording alone — which is exactly what the GitHub button does
# today. Run this if you want the buttons to look like the shipping app.
